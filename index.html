        <h1>STUDENT SCHEDULING SYSTEM</h1>
        <p>
            This site contains the initial version of our scheduling system project. Many things may not be as good
            or look as good as they would in the final version, but the basic functionality should be present. Further
            improvements upon functionality, appearance, and various "under the hood" things(such as making code more
            efficient or clean without altering the appearance/functionality of the site) will follow in future releases
            of this site.

    <!--This section is for the schedule entry form, it also makes the event name mandatory as without an event name the date is meaningless. It also defines the type of inputs, will try playing around with the calendar entry in part 3.-->
